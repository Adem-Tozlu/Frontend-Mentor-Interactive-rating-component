# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component

This is a solution to the [Design preview for the Interactive rating component coding challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI/hub)

The challenge is to build out this interactive rating component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
